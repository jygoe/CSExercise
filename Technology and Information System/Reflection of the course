By studying TIS, I learned about the technology and various components of the Internet that have always been around us. Every assignment I completed left me 
impressed with the activities we did. For example, in design thinking, the topic for our group is social media. When completing this assignment, we deeply explored 
the various problems users encountered when using social media, and selected one of the most serious problems(Internet Fraud and Scams) to provide a solution for it. 
Besides, upon particitaping to these talk, I have a clear goals on my career development path. I will always strengthen my skills and discover new technology to become
more competitve in the industry. Thanks to TIS, made my goals clearer, broadened my knowledge, and helped me better adapt to future career development.
