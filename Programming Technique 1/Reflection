After studying with PT1 for a semester, I mastered basic programming skills and now can independently complete simple programming in C++. This course on programming 
technique helped me better understand the operation and logic of programming. I also learned various topics, such as function and array. I believe these skills can 
help me better master the courses that I have to learn next and contribute to my future career development.
