This subject has made my mind more rational, my thinking sharper, and my mind more flexible. It allows me to think more carefully about any problem without 
getting confused. After studying as a semester, I have a greater grasp of the topics I have learned. Although many of them have been learned before, the topic 
learned have become more in-depth after taking the degree. I hope that the knowledge I learned in discrete structure can be applied to my future career.
