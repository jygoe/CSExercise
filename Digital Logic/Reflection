For me, this course started very simply and was about gate logic. But by the fifth module, I felt it was getting harder and harder and I started to be 
unable to keep up with what the lecturer was teaching. After going back to my hostel room, I need to review it again before I can understand it. But later, 
when I didn't understand something in class, I would raise my hand and ask a question so that the lecturer could repeat it then I could understand better. 
Overall, this course is quite challenging for me, but I feel very accomplished after mastering it.
